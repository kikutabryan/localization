# localization

A research project I worked on over the summer of 2023 focusing on the localization of autonomous drones in GNSS denied environments through the utilization of ArUco fiducial markers placed on the floor.

This was conducted at the Autonomous Vehicles Laboratory run by Dr. Reza Faieghi.
